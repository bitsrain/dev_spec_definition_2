"Invite to job" modal's message box is prepopulated by Upwork. But it could be edited.

---------- 4-invited-freelancer-msg-history ------
Invited freelancer's msg history is different from the normal bidders.
Note that the client's invitation message comes first.

Invited freelancer appears in msgs page only if he/she accepted the invite (submitted the proposal). If denied, doesn't show up in the msgs page.
